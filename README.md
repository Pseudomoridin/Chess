# **CHESS Q-LEARNING AI**
Chess AI that will learn how to play chess based on it moving randomly and being rewarded for different actions, weighted differently based on their importance.
The game itself is unfinished- the collision logic for the bishop is unfinished and the AI has not been implemented.
The AI will not play against itself, it needs a human to play against.
